# 🔗 SolveChain – Decentralized Knowledge Exchange Platform

SolveChain is a full-stack, blockchain-integrated platform designed to reward structured, high-quality problem solving with tokenized incentives. Built with a modern MERN-style stack enhanced by Web3 and Firebase, it demonstrates deep integration of real-time data, authentication, and smart contracts—all while solving a real-world need: making expert knowledge accessible, structured, and worth contributing.

## 🚀 What Is SolveChain?

Imagine StackOverflow, Coursera, and Gitcoin combined—only open, decentralized, and reward-driven. SolveChain empowers users to:

- Post detailed **challenges or problems** in any domain
- Receive **solutions from experts or the community**, with guides, videos, or code
- Earn and spend **SolveCoin**, a custom ERC-20 token, to incentivize knowledge exchange

This project is a capstone-level demonstration of **full-stack, cross-domain engineering** including:
- Frontend  (Vue.js)
- RESTful API backend (Node.js + Express)
- Real-time Discussion (Firebase )
- MongoDB for data persistence
- Smart contracts for tokenization (Solidity + Hardhat)

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

SolveChain is more than a coding exercise—it's a response to three real-world issues:

- 💸 **Knowledge is underpaid.** People who help others online often don’t get rewarded fairly.
- 🗑️ **Q&A platforms are cluttered.** Unstructured replies, low-quality answers, and spam abound.
- 🔐 **Platforms are centralized.** They control content, rewards, and visibility.

With SolveChain, **users control their data**, earn **real value for helpfulness**, and participate in a system built around **merit, clarity, and transparency**.
